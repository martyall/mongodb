# this follows this module of the week tutorial on http://pymotw.com/2/json/
# here is a brief description of the JSON format: he json module provides an
# API similar to pickle for converting in-memory Python objects to a serialized
# representation known as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
# Unlike pickle, JSON has the benefit of having
# implementations in many languages (especially
# JavaScript), making it suitable for inter-application
# communication. JSON is probably most widely used for
# communicating between the web server and client in an
# AJAX application, but is not limited to that problem domain.

import json


data = [{'a': 'A', 'b': (2, 4), 'c': 3.0}]
print 'Data:', repr(data)

data_string = json.dumps(data)
print 'JSON:', data_string
