processing the file:
- process only 2 types of top level tags: "node" and "way"
- turn all the attributes in these tages into regular key/val pairs except for the following particular instructions
1. attrs in the "CREADTED" array should be added under the key "created"
2. map "lat" and "lon" into an array called "pos", whose vals are floats, and used for geospacial indexing (internal to mongodb)
3. if the second level tag "k" contains irregular chars, ignore it
4. if the second level tag "k" starts with "addr:" but contains ":", put in a dictionary "address"
5. if the second level tag "k" contains ":" but doesn't start with "addr", process it like the other tags
6. if ther is a second ":" that separates the type/direction of a street, ignore the whole tag
